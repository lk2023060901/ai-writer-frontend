# Sidebar Component Completion Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of the remaining Sidebar components to match the intended architecture. The goal is to create a properly structured, modular sidebar with all components organized according to the architectural design, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: BottomMenus Component

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated BottomMenus component that encapsulates all bottom menu functionality, so that the sidebar structure is properly organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a BottomMenus component at the bottom
2. WHEN the BottomMenus component is rendered THEN it SHALL contain ThemeButton and SettingsButton components
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the BottomMenus component SHALL adapt its layout appropriately
4. WHEN the BottomMenus component is rendered THEN it SHALL have proper visual separation from the main content area

### Requirement 2: Sidebar-Specific Theme and Settings Buttons

**User Story:** As a user, I want theme and settings buttons that are specifically designed for the sidebar context, so that they integrate seamlessly with the sidebar's design and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThemeButton is rendered in the sidebar THEN it SHALL be located in the sidebar components directory
2. WHEN the SettingsButton is rendered in the sidebar THEN it SHALL be located in the sidebar components directory
3. WHEN either button is clicked in collapsed mode THEN the system SHALL show appropriate tooltips
4. WHEN the theme button is clicked THEN it SHALL toggle between light/dark/system themes
5. WHEN the settings button is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the settings page

### Requirement 3: Component Architecture Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all sidebar components to follow a consistent architectural pattern, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows the established design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any sidebar component is implemented THEN it SHALL be located in the `src/components/layout/sidebar/` directory
2. WHEN any sidebar component receives props THEN it SHALL include proper TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN any sidebar component is rendered THEN it SHALL support both collapsed and expanded states
4. WHEN any sidebar component uses icons THEN it SHALL use Material Symbols icons consistently

### Requirement 4: Proper Component Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all sidebar components to work together seamlessly, so that the navigation experience is smooth and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Sidebar component is rendered THEN it SHALL use the BottomMenus component instead of individual buttons
2. WHEN the BottomMenus component is rendered THEN it SHALL receive the collapsed state from the parent Sidebar
3. WHEN any navigation action occurs THEN it SHALL be properly handled through the navigation system
4. WHEN the sidebar state changes THEN all child components SHALL update their appearance accordingly

### Requirement 5: Visual Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bottom menu area to have consistent visual design with the rest of the sidebar, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BottomMenus component is rendered THEN it SHALL have a top border to separate it from the main content
2. WHEN buttons are rendered in the bottom menu THEN they SHALL use consistent padding and spacing
3. WHEN the sidebar is in collapsed mode THEN the bottom menu SHALL show only icons with tooltips
4. WHEN the sidebar is in expanded mode THEN the bottom menu SHALL show icons with labels
5. WHEN hovering over bottom menu items THEN they SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the bottom menu components to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate and use all functionality regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all bottom menu items SHALL be focusable and operable
2. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all bottom menu items SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels
3. WHEN in collapsed mode THEN tooltips SHALL provide context for icon-only buttons
4. WHEN any button is activated THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback about the action taken
